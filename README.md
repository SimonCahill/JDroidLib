JDroidLib
=========

JDroidLib is a Java class library, based off of regaw_leinad's AndroidLib, written in C#. 
JDroidLib attempts to provide the same functionality, though it's designed for use in Java, 
thus making it available for virtually any OS

JDroidLib has also been featured by many sites, including the infamous XDA-Devlopers portal!
