/**
 * JDroidLib's main class.
 * Always create an instance of this class and derive other classes from here.
 * {@see CaptainKirk} is <u>not</u> meant to be used by anything other than JDroidLib - Only use in emergencies!
 * 
 * To "start" JDroidLib, use the following code:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class YourClass {
 *      private final ADBController adbController; // Make this final when possible, you're not going to need to change this. <b>ONLY CREATE ONE INSTANCE PER PROGRAM!</b>
 * 
 *      public YourClass() {
 *          try {
 *              adbController = new ADBController(); // Assign final variable adbController value of new object, type ADBController
 *          } catch (IOException | ZipException | InterruptedException ex) { // ADBController's constructor throws these exceptions
 *              System.err.println("Error starting JDroidLib (CODE: BLA)); // You don't have to do this..
 *              ex.printStackTrace(System.err);
 *          }
 *      }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * That code initializes JDroidLib and automatically tells JDroidLib to copy any and all needed files to the local hard drive. These are deleted once the JVM exits.
 * 
 * To get an instance of FastbootController, use the following code (make sure you have a running instance of ADBController):
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * private final FastbootController fbController = adbController.getFastbootController(); // Make it final where you can, you won't need to change it.
 * }
 * </pre>
